# racist-ai
um well its an ai thats racist

# how it works:
to put it simply the bot searches through a huge dataset of tweets and finds the one most correlated to the inputted query

# installs required
using pip run these commands in terminal or cmd prompt based on your os(not all at once, line by line):
pip install panda
pip install skicit-learn
from scipy import spatial
pip install numpy
pip install nltk

# possible modifications
if you want to model this "ai" after yourself simply replace the data in tweets.csv with some things you may say, i.e hi, how are you doing, im good, etc...
