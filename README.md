# Dependencies

# How it works:
to put it simply the bot searches through a huge dataset of tweets and finds the one most correlated to the inputted query

# Install
using pip run these commands in terminal or cmd prompt based on your os(not all at once, line by line):
```
git clone https://github.com/Nyelsonon/racist-ai.git
cd racist-ai
pip install panda
pip install skicit-learn
from scipy import spatial
pip install numpy
pip install nltk
python3 racistgen.py
```

# Possible modifications
if you want to model this "ai" after yourself simply replace the data in tweets.csv with some things you may say, i.e hi, how are you doing, im good, etc...
